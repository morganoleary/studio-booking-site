## Bugs/Unfixed Bugs:
- Fixed: When creating my apps, I decided I needed to separate my models for member details from the class details and booking models in a separate app. I changed the name of my original 'book' app to 'member' as this already contained my Member and MemberLogin models that had been migrated to the database and deployed on Heroku. I followed the steps and successfully changed the name of the app by utilizing the [django-rename-app](https://github.com/odwyersoftware/django-rename-app?tab=readme-ov-file).
- Fixed: When implementing Django signals into the "member" app when trying to create a user profile for each user that signs up, I received the following error: django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Application labels aren't unique, duplicates: member . After researching, I was able to fix the problem my removing the 'member' in INSTALLED_APPS of the Settings file. This was found using [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319558/how-to-resolve-django-core-exceptions-improperlyconfigured-application-labels).

# Deployment

## Steps taken to deploy on Heroku:
Set up the workspace:
1. Install gunicorn in workspace for Heroku deployment
2. Add to requirements.txt and create Procfile
3. In settings.py set DEBUG = False
4. Git add, commit and push changes to GitHub
Deploy on Heroku:
5. Create the app on Heroku and connect to GitHub project
6. Set the Config Vars in the "Settings" Tab
7. Navigate to the "Deploy" tab and scroll down to click on "Deploy Branch" in the "Manual deploy" section

# Credits
- Student support on Slack was very helpful setting up database configurations in the settings.py file.
- [Creating a Database](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSD101_WTS+2023_Q3/courseware/56a2da0940b4411d8a38c2b093a22c60/ed8c75412c784bbba17988f7efbe037b/?child=first) content in the "I Think Therefore I Blog" walkthrough was utilized to create the database. 
- From the 'I think therefore I blog' walkthrough project, [Django Walkthrough Project / Setting up the base template](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSD101_WTS+2023_Q3/courseware/56a2da0940b4411d8a38c2b093a22c60/c592ed45498e440587b764e29891b2fc/?child=first) was helpful when creating the base template.
- [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/)
- From the 'I think therefore I blog' walkthrough project, [Deployment with static files](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSD101_WTS+2023_Q3/courseware/56a2da0940b4411d8a38c2b093a22c60/c592ed45498e440587b764e29891b2fc/?child=first) was utilized to ensure successful deployment after creating static files.
- From the 'I think therefore I blog' walkthrough project, [Django AllAuth Authentication](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSD101_WTS+2023_Q3/courseware/56a2da0940b4411d8a38c2b093a22c60/8354ed2193944d4ea9aa167849113da7/) and [Django Documentation](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/installation/quickstart.html) were used to install and wire up Django AllAuth. 
- [Django debug log](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/logging/#id5) was provided by tutor support to assist with finding specific issues in code.
- [Django Views URL Names](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/account/views.html#login) were found here, with the help of tutor support, to reference Django account files within custom templates.
- Understanding the Django User Model was found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/contrib/auth/#django.contrib.auth.models.User).
- The use of Django signals, specifically the 'post_save' signal was implemented with the idea from [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@abdullafajal/automating-user-profile-creation-with-default-data-using-django-signals-50abef9ce529) and assistance from [Django Signal Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/signals/).
