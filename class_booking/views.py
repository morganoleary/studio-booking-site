# booking page from menu
## if user is authenticated (logged in) >> booking page (booking.html)

### book a class >> inserts user info (hello user!), provides dates & times available (choices), with submit btn
### class choices = class, date, time (need to add date & time choices to Booking model???)
### when submitted >> capacity is updated, booking sent to admin site, success message of booking (w/ details), redirect to user profile (member_profile.html) w/ updated class list

## if user is NOT authenticated >> sign in page w/ option to sign up (if not done already)

### ((sign in page >>> should redirect user to booking page? home page?))
